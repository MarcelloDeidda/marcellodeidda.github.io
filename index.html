            <p>My first programming experience was creating RPG games as a teenager, with the help of a software called RPG Maker. Fifteen years later I decided to start teaching myself how to code. Ever since, I've been learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Java, SQL, MongoDB. I have recently embarked on a new learning opportunity with HyperionDev and am attending their Software Engineering course based on Python. This has given me the motivation to work hard on my projects and create a portfolio, aiming to someday start a career in this field.</p>
            <p>Based in London since 2015, I have trained as a classical violinist and work as a self-employed music teacher. I follow students of varied age, and I prepare them for violin and piano graded exams, or simply help them learn how to play for their own enjoyement.</p>
            <p>I love walking, exploring the city and the countryside, travelling and getting to know new places. I am a sociable person and enjoy spending time with family and friends. I am a teacher by nature, and always feel up for sharing my passion and knowledge with others. In my leisure time I enjoy cooking, reading, gaming as well as listening, playing and composing music.</p>
